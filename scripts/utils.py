    Normalize project name for consistent hashing across import/search.

    - Claude logs format: -Users-kyle-Code-claude-self-reflect -> claude-self-reflect

    - Regular paths: /path/to/project -> project
    - Already normalized: project -> project
    - Docker mount paths: /logs/-Users-name-projects-project -> project
